<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #0dc596;">Anon, 2020 (16personalities.com); indicates that my personality is classified as &ldquo;an assertive campaigner, a diplomat and that my personality also involves people mastery&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: ##0dc596;">What does the MBTI indicate for me (in my own words)</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #82b078;">The results of the MBTI test show me that I'm quite extraverted which is quite true (most of the time) - I'm not a dry robot and generally through my daily duties I prefer being out with people.&nbsp; My nature shows that I'm good at handling emotions and have a good "Feel" for things. Tactics wise - I am known to be a bit of a strategist/master tactician in some cases. Identity wise - the assertive part isn't an exact match as I am probably not assertive enough in a lot of situations&mdash;only some of the time. I wouldn't' say that this is very accurate. I do not believe this has the most accuracy when gauging how a person would behave in a team simply due to how the test gathers information about a person not taking into account more "work-ethic" factors found in other tests. It does touch on this vaguely but doesn't goo too in-depth with this. I wouldn't rely on this as my first choice.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0dc596;">What does this mean for a team ? </span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #8db43e;">I think these results suggest that I'm an extroverted team player that gets a good feel for a group while being able to use a bit of tactical strategy for the greater good. For example, if one person seems to be negatively geared towards an idea - I would encourage this as an outlet to facilitate further thinking and ideas rather than grab the "going south express" and enable the negative aspects further in a derogatory way. Assertiveness need not apply here, as I'd avoid this. It's important to note that the MTBI test was created with self-development in mind and seems subjective. If you give ten people a licorice piece, you'll get 20 answers on what it's like with similar meaning. This test would take into account how I'm not a reserved, quiet personality within the team, more a semi-rambunctious character with a little filter applied when it comes to sharing thoughts. Quite often people need to be more concerned about me answering their questions more freely than most would - hence, the need for them to filter the question - rather than have me filter my answer- which I simply don't do - unless I'm on the far end of uncomfortable with the group. At least the group would know all of my thoughts. Communication is a good strength I have, perhaps a bit overdone for those not practiced/versed in this behavior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #9fd92b;">It is interesting how the test shows that I am LESS of an extrovert, and the results are quite different. However, Imagination is a key strength of mine with my wacky ideas as shown in the test results. While in real life, not everyone is going to agree with my imaginative ideas; they would certainly discuss them with me in-depth where required. I don't tend to shy away from talking about ideas if I believe the effort will amount to something considered worthy of the time invested. If at the very least the test accuracy is put to the question - it is entertaining to see. So whilst more valid than the Myers Briggs test, again - I would not use this as my primary test mechanism to gauge a team. However, it would provide some useful insight to provide a better understanding versus not having one at all. If anything these tests would make a good ice-breaker for team members engaging in a conversation about doing these tests at the very least.&nbsp; if we consider how the Predictive tests work along with the Myers Briggs test - it's quite clear to see which one holds accurate at least in my case</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #75de29;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anon, 2020. [online] Available at: (</span><a style="color: #0dc596;" href="https://www.predictiveindex.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.predictiveindex.com/assessments/behavioral-assessment/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">); indicates that my personality is classified as &ldquo;I get my sense of satisfaction from supporting others &ldquo;- and this holds at work and in most things I do. However, I'm not the most detail-oriented but sometimes get caught up in the details a little too much distracting me from work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>TEAM WISE </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This does demonstrate how I would help others out in my team providing a positive culture to work with. I personally believe this is true. I tend to get the most amount of work done when it's a well-knit team running like clockwork.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #76be1e;">Being the ENFP-A Type - I think this should be taken into account, moving into a team short of teamwork where key players focus more on self progression rather than team progression. There is no "I" in a team.<br /><br />This test is probably the most comprehensive of all three and I would use this as my first option. It delves into the mindset with a work-ethic oriented style. It would be better used in a team where sharing information is critical and would be able to provide suggestions on how to approach certain people with varying characteristics. This test appears like it's more for professional usage. If we examine the screenshots it's quite accurate unlike the other two that don't seem to hit a solid target with much of anything - they may as well be astrology articles in the newspaper. You can always mold it to your situation in a vague way.&nbsp;</span></p>
