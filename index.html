<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Language-wise I only speak English and would love to learn another language as I do have an interest in traveling where this would come in handy in order to soak up the culture better of where I travel. A big challenge for me was growing up; my father never wanted me to learn my family's native tongue (Italian) - </span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ae9e7c;">There is nothing wrong with a date night indoors on a Friday night enjoying some pizza and ice cream watching some Sci-fi on TV creating that much needed inner world to explore while enjoying time with loved ones.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c6a284;">Education-wise - I studied a Certificate III in Web applications &amp; Information technology after not finishing secondary school. I chose adventure and life over school.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c3c89b;">During this time - I breezed through this learning new things - such as Flash, Dreamweaver, Office applications (more in-depth i.e., not just how to turn a PC on and type documents) we used notepad to edit HTML mainly for our assignments(required). I achieved high distinctions making a few silly mistakes lowering some scores, and I enjoyed studying.&nbsp;</span></li>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #7c9ee0;"><strong>Some quirky facts about me</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am known to adopt some fairly quirky ideas when solving problems. At work, sometimes we get crates of IT Equipment that needed to get delivered around the site. My Plan to save a chunk of time was to get a crane stuck into the containers and lift them from the basement to the turbine floor. Everyone thought I was insane for coming up with this idea, but they all agreed that if you wanted it done quickly, this would be the way to do it. I&rsquo;m usually the one to come up with quirky or untraditional ways to complete tasks and I thrive from this. I am somewhat like a crazy Macgyver when it comes to ideas.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sports wise - I&rsquo;m into cycling, gym, and tennis. </span></span></p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #1ec6aa;"><strong>Why am I even interested in IT at all? What's the big idea?</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3cc6a8;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My interest in IT Sparked my first IBM XT computer. The family purchased this computer for me and I learned DOS syntax and moved onto Windows / Linux later on keeping my heart set on wanting to work in the IT Industry. I like the idea of being able to help people on some kind of level that makes even but a small difference in their lives with any advantage I can get! If I could just &ldquo;Write that program&rdquo; or write that code / have a more useful skillset as my tool-belt then the IT World I&rsquo;m involved in will be a much better place.&nbsp; I enjoy tinkering with hardware, applications, It&rsquo;s not uncommon to find me working on a script or messing around with the innards of computers. This is why I&rsquo;m here studying with RMIT, to develop my current skill set into something more broad and useful so I can advance my career in IT rather than get stuck at the same level for the rest of my career. I really want to be an absolute wizard in my daily work life. Not only this, I will gain a personal enjoyment overcoming all of the challenges thrown my way applying relevant time management and discipline skills needed to succeed. I currently have some PowerShell, AD, SCCM, registry editor, WMI, PS-remoting, psexec, Windows-based admin knowledge. I&rsquo;ve tinkered with Linux and Max OS a little. I can set up home modems and basic devices. I really want to be able to fully control what is achieved with a much broader skill-set and apply it to my workplace. If the job needs a small program written - then I&rsquo;ll be able to do that. </span></span></p>
