<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Personal information</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Hi - my name is Bradley McCarthy. My student id is S386661/ Email S386661@student.rmit.edu.au -picture -My descendants are from all over the world (My Grandmother is from Cairo, Egypt &amp; Grandfather from the border of Yugoslavia / Italy) - I generally have a zest for life and I&rsquo;m usually a happy person. Especially after consuming tasty pancakes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Language-wise I only speak English and would love to learn another language as I do have an interest in traveling where this would come in handy in order to soak up the culture better of where I travel. A big challenge for me was growing up; my father never wanted me to learn my family's native tongue (Italian) - There is nothing wrong with a date night indoors on a Friday night enjoying some pizza and ice cream watching some Sci-fi on TV creating that much needed inner world to explore while enjoying time with loved ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Education-wise - I studied a Certificate III in Web applications &amp; Information technology after not finishing secondary school. I chose adventure and life over school.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">I breezed through this learning new things - such as Flash, Dreamweaver, Office applications (more in-depth i.e., not just how to turn a PC on and type documents) we used notepad to edit HTML mainly for our assignments(required). I achieved high distinctions making a few silly mistakes lowering some scores, and I enjoyed studying.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>A few interesting facts about me</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am known to adopt some fairly quirky ideas when solving problems. At work, sometimes we get crates of IT Equipment that needed to get delivered around the site. My Plan to save a chunk of time was to get a crane stuck into the containers and lift them from the basement to the turbine floor. Everyone thought I was insane for coming up with this idea, but they all agreed that if you wanted it done quickly, this would be the way to do it. I&rsquo;m usually the one to come up with quirky or untraditional ways to complete tasks and I thrive from this. Sports wise - I&rsquo;m into cycling, gym, and tennis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>My interest in IT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My interest in IT Sparked my first IBM XT computer. Family purchased this computer for me and I learned DOS syntax and moved onto Windows / Linux later on keeping my heart set on wanting to work in the IT Industry. I like the idea of being able to help people on some kind of level that makes even but a small difference in their lives with any advantage I can get! If I could just &ldquo;Write that program&rdquo; or write that code / have a more useful skillset as my tool-belt then the IT World I&rsquo;m involved in will be a much better place.&nbsp; I enjoy tinkering with hardware, applications, It&rsquo;s not uncommon to find me working on a script or messing around with the innards of computers. This is why I&rsquo;m here, to develop my current skill set into something more broad and useful so I can advance my career in IT rather than get stuck at the same level for the rest of my career. I currently have some PowerShell, AD, SCCM, registry editor, WMI, PS-remoting, psexec, Windows-based admin knowledge. I&rsquo;ve tinkered with Linux and Max OS a little. I can set up home modems and basic devices. I really want to be able to fully control what is achieved with a much broader skill-set and apply it to my workplace. If the job needs a small program written - then I&rsquo;ll be able to do that. It just makes sense to have knowledge of IoT, IT Security, Networking, programming, automation, scripting, and how the general puzzle gets put together. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>Job description in my own words</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">This defense organization wants a person experienced with Linux and Windows administration that knows how to handle Active Directory as well as virtual machines. I&rsquo;m not sure how deep this goes in the environment but one would assume in this role it&rsquo;s for server applications mainly. This is where the Windows server / PowerShell / group policy may come in more handy. So in this particular case - user account management, network management as well as managing log on rules/domain / environmental rules are required. Sounds like a more challenging senior IT Role where you would get to learn a wide range of skills that would be transferable in the IT workforce</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>EXAMPLE OF JOB</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">&nbsp;The job description requires a fairly advanced IT Security skillset and cloud knowledge on top of existing strong IT Administration skills.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Why does the job appeal to me</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">I like the idea of exploring a wide range of new skills to advance my career even further combining this with what I learn from RMIT to apply this in my IT career. Essentially I would learn how to harden networks, learn about the Linux side of it more which isn&rsquo;t something I encounter every day in the workforce and then I would also be able to get into the realm of virtualization, and a good feel for MS Infrastructure (Group policy, domain roles, AD / DNS / DHCP) - more importantly it would give me a deeper mechanical understanding of how Linux/Windows operates than what I can employ now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Experience &amp; Qualifications required for the job</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Microsoft certification that covers how to correctly administer the domain and sub-ste features would be ideal. How to manage your staff/users and the software in the environment.&nbsp; A certification that covers the desktop and server/cloud side would be largely beneficial as a senior support staff member. Having this certification gives you a good foundation of the tool-set that Microsoft would have you employ in the everyday life of a qualified IT administrator on the&nbsp; side. So rather than being a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">click-next administrator</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this would provide a better understanding of what&rsquo;s under the hood. As an example - you would be a very well certified IT staff member that knew how to get things done rather than a clever researcher. These two cannot be mutually exclusive.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further to this VMware Certification would cover how to utilize correct virtualization techniques so things don&rsquo;t go wrong as easy and there is a full understanding of how Windows/Linux/Other systems get implemented whether it&rsquo;s for raw material boxes or cloud infrastructure. By having this certification you are using VMware to its capability and applying it securely. This would be extremely handy to have on top of the Microsoft certifications where any virtualization will be beneficial as the two can be combined for various applications. Eg deploying a windows server 2019 box on a cloud farm for hosting a service&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Cisco CCNA would provide further tools I need to gain a very deep understanding of how everything connects to a network. Without this knowledge or understanding how everything ties together on the network, this facilitates better problem management and well-handled deployments where there is no guesswork involved. This would cover routing tables, DHCP, DNS, Vlan&rsquo;s, infrastructure, Power over ethernet, wiring up fibre/ethernet cables, and even how to secure the network correctly &amp; use the cisco console effectively without needing to refer to the documentation every 5 seconds.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>A Description of my current job Skills</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Currently, I don't have any relevant qualifications that would get me a job like this, however-&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">My previous certification in IT&nbsp; covered how to use office applications and program some HTML. This is not enough. In terms of today's requirements, the only transferable knowledge would be my current experience in</span></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Powershell automation (self-taught 2+ years)</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Active Directory (Basic user level) - managing software and security groups</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Basic Linux / CLI "to get by"&nbsp;</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>RDP/MSRA/CLI/WinRM (PS remoting)</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Basic SCCM knowledge</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Application / remote technical support knowledge</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Very Basic MSOL experience.&nbsp;</strong></span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>How will I obtain the skills I need?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Well, the first thing I need to focus on doing is complete the Bachelor of IT / programming Once I achieve this, I will then be able to look forward to completing other certifications I've wanted to do for quite some time. Cisco CCNA, Linux Certification, Microsoft Desktop management skills, Azure / cloud-based certifications. These would require a good chunk of time outside of my course unless RMIT could help incorporate these somehow into the existing structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>MYERS BRIGGS TEST</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><a style="color: #c2c7d1;" href="https://imgur.com/fcQMBT5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://imgur.com/fcQMBT5</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Anon, 2020 (16personalities.com); indicates that my personality is classified as &ldquo;an assertive campaigner, a diplomat and that my personality also involves people mastery&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>What does the MBTI indicate for me (in my own words)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">The results of the MBTI test show me that I'm quite extraverted which is quite true (most of the time) - I'm not a dry robot and generally through my daily duties I prefer being out with people.&nbsp; My nature shows that I'm good at handling emotions and have a good "Feel" for things. Tactics wise - I am known to be a bit of a strategist/master tactician in some cases. Identity wise - the assertive part isn't an exact match as I am probably not assertive enough in a lot of situations&mdash;only some of the time. I wouldn't' say that this is very accurate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>TEAM WISE&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">I think these results suggest that I'm an extroverted team player that gets a good feel for a group while being able to use a bit of tactical strategy for the greater good. For example, if one person seems to be negatively geared towards an idea - I would encourage this as an outlet to facilitate further thinking and ideas rather than grab the "going south express" and enable the negative aspects further in a derogatory way. Assertiveness need not apply here, as I'd avoid this. It's important to note that the MTBI test was created with self-development in mind and seems subjective. If you give ten people a licorice piece, you'll get 20 answers on what it's like with similar meaning. This test would take into account how I'm not a reserved, quiet personality within the team, more a semi-rambunctious character with a little filter applied when it comes to sharing thoughts. Quite often people need to be more concerned about me answering their questions more freely than most would - hence, the need for them to filter the question - rather than have me filter my answer- which I simply don't do - unless I'm on the far end of uncomfortable with the group. At least the group would know all of my thoughts. Communication is a good strength I have, perhaps a bit overdone for those not practiced/versed in this behavior.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Results (with 3x factors)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">It is interesting how the test shows that I am LESS of an extrovert, and the results are quite different. However, Imagination is a key strength of mine with my wacky ideas as shown in the test results. While in real life, not everyone is going to agree with my imaginative ideas; they would certainly discuss them with me in-depth where required. I don't tend to shy away from talking about ideas if I believe the effort will amount to something considered worthy of the time invested. If at the very least the test accuracy is put to the question - it is entertaining to see.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Predictive index test</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anon, 2020. [online] Available at: (</span><a style="color: #c2c7d1;" href="https://www.predictiveindex.com/assessments/behavioral-assessment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.predictiveindex.com/assessments/behavioral-assessment/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">); indicates that my personality is classified as &ldquo;I get my sense of satisfaction from supporting others &ldquo;- and this holds at work and in most things I do. However, I'm not the most detail-oriented but sometimes get caught up in the details a little too much distracting me from work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>TEAM WISE </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This does demonstrate how I would help others out in my team but may annoy some people as I'd be focusing more on helping others individually than the entire team when overall progression is desired. If you've got a few people that are a little stuck behind as a collective everyone needs to be on board and we've all got circumstances, so it doesn't hurt to consider that for everybody.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">I think this should be taken into account, moving into a team short of teamwork where key players focus more on self progression rather than team progression. There is no "I" in a team.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Project idea</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">My project would be about an "EnCon" dynamic module that connects to a smartphone app wirelessly / cell network to automate everyday power conservation. Each module would cost around $59-99 depending on how broad it's function was. Envisage this "module/unit" to connect to your car, to your household appliances/lights/switchboard and powering things off that haven't been used for a set duration of time to save electricity. Instead of having several different apps for different energy providers, apps that save fuel, and even communications apps - It would be a central "energy" hub incorporating everything. It would also serve to track consumption on the app so you can see your overall "Expenditure" and provide tips on how to improve it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">For a smart meter, it would add some "Extra smart" to it by plugging into the circuit board with newly designed circuits that are far more robust and communicate to the app wirelessly on your network with a small master chip. This would give people a better indication of peak vs. off-peak times, and you'd be able to focus on saving energy - and this could also be used for governing bodies as a tracking mechanism for disputes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">I would call this ecosystem "EnCon," It would be able to connect to just about everything desired.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Motivation</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">My motivation for this is based on a personal ethos - why use resources when we don't need to? By being more conscious and having the right modern tools that can do this - it is possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">The broader application of such a product would be useful in areas where resources are starved and very limited. It would have installations on Marine, military, and domestic use. Marine for better power monitoring and management (Eg cruise ship) - Military/police, to record a solid subset of data for investigative usage. This creates a massive demand for an extremely wide user base. This is the next generation of eco-conscious people as well as the elderly. Hospital applications</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Description</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">The primary basis of the service would be a web/app-based subscription model where the user needs to spend $5 a month for the most basic level of service - the monitoring central hub side of "EnCon" which would focus on far cheaper modules that sell for $29 that do not have any automation capabilities. This is so all energy consumptions/vehicle/communications/appliances/hubs can be monitored in a central location. In this case, "Basic EnCom smart modules" would be installed to a person's smart-meter / fuse box, connect up various appliances for more detailed costs, not just an overall "Feel" of things - and then even somehow connect to the water meter at the property to measure this. All utilities would be connected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">The more capable modules would cost $99 for a basic start-up kit, including a few monitoring modules and an "automation" module. The premium product would be $299 and include 6x monitoring modules, and cover a small house with automation (6x lights, 8x power socket modules, smart-meter module, water module). People who spend $10 p/m on the app would have full access to the cool automation side. This would be the no holds barred version. Car "ECU" module would be available for $49 - there would be several other niche models available. A "Strava" EnCom module would be available for cyclists who commute to work for $35 that works from an ANT+ sensor and collects data from your Garmin / Wahoo unit to track how much fuel/consumption has been saved. When driving, it would calculate your cost of fuel rather than relying on per 100K Ratings that never really show the cost until you fill-up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">A user would simply connect these modules as it if was a network switch or device plugged into their home network and connect every unit up to a Master module included in the box. The master module would need a very high level of security as who wants their house "Hacked"?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Some kind of "locator" module could be used to refine the more conservative modes to follow the person. This could be wearable or the smartphone app. So if you have the wearable on you, or your phone - it won't turn anything off in that room as you're in it (if it's a light or something else you could be using)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">But if it's detected, you are leaving the house, and it will gauge this and shut things down as required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">It would be a 2 step setup process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Step 1 - power on and enter a password when the LED is turned on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Step 2 - it detects all the modules installed and powered on and connects them - It then loads the default "Eco" profile set to turn anything off automatically after 15 minutes. Naturally, you wouldn't want your fridge connected to this. This is where the monitoring modules would be useful. You'd plug this module into things that didn't need automation but just monitoring.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Tools and software / Skills required.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineers to come up with a beta/draft design that can go out to the field, followed by an application that would be able to run the "smart" side of the modules to inform the user of all the consumption involved and tips on how to save, etc. Then, You'd need a factory that can print PCB's to your specification. Software like AutoDesk Eagle would assist in the design of the PCB using CAD software on some moderately specced PCs. Kicad could also be used and is free. AutoDesk requires a subscription nowadays when it never used to. Programmers would be needed to write the smartphone app and firmware/kernel/software for the smart module onto the onboard memory chips that contain the function of each "EnCon" Module. Still, it would also need some very talented "Hackers" or ITSec people (possibly both) to ensure it's as secure as possible around the clock, so people don't have to worry about being compromised. They would need to "harden" the firmware/software as much as possible and only release necessary updates. There would be cloud servers involved to store customer information and manage subscriptions. It would certainly not encourage "ads" or "selling information" - it would be 100% ethical. The data on the servers would not be accessible even to staff without law intervening, noting that even this would be encrypted data.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>So in essence ;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Create a program that can measure power usage and automate choices for appliances that can be turned off automatically to save power and make more conscious choices. If successful, it would be a "green" use product. This aims towards a better future for everyone. It would have an impact on the environment if even the product itself could be recycled and attribute towards people using less electricity by using the automation tools provided.</span></p>
