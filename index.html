<title> Welcome to Brad's Professional IT Profile S386661 </title>
<h1><center>IT Profile - Personal information </h1></center> 

<p> My name is Bradley McCarthy, student id S386661, Email address <S386661@student class="rmit edu au"></S386661@student>   
The universe decided I'd be created as a human being with a very mixed background in terms of nationality as my descendants are from all over the world (My Grandmother is from Cairo, Egypt) 
I only speak English, but I would love to learn another language as I do have interest in travelling. 
One fact about me is, I am known to adopt some fairly quirky ideas when solving problems. Most of the time, these ideas seem very out of place and bat-sh*t crazy however when it all clicks into place it's like a satisfactory puzzle that's just been put together.   
I love driving my Ford Focus XR5 Turbo, it's not a car that's designed to throw you out the back window when you give it some beans - however it's a very well balanced fun car to drive when the solid stuff gets bendy. Given that it's 6 speed manual, that makes it even better.   
This is another fun fact about me - I learned how to drive manual after getting the car. I've only stalled it twice since November last year, and they weren't traditional "stalling" mistakes - they were far worse (wrong gear selection) as the car doesn't have a rev limiter to protect the engine 
Aside from this, I'm passionate about making music and have been doing this since Windows 95/98 using Scream Tracker / Impulse tracker and then other newer applications (FL studio 7/8/9/10 and now whatever the almost current version is) 
Sports wise I love Cycling, Tennis and absolutely cannot wait to get back into the gym - part of my routine is getting up at an hour nobody including myself wants to be doing (typically 430am) and getting  30-45 minute workout done if not an hour some days and then getting to work. 
I currently work for a historically known tier 1 computer company through one of it's contractors for a generation site the state relies on for an essential service. Without this service, many of us wouldn't be reading this page right now if plugged into mains

My interest in compters & IT started when my Great uncle and Grandmother purchased an IBM XT with CGA Graphics, 640KB Ram and a 40MB MFM Hard disk with a strange looking keyboard by today's standards. The function keys were on the left, not at the top. There were only ten of them.Very little software made use of 12 function keys 
I had MS-DOS 5.00 loaded on the PC for me and I didn't recieve an "upgrade" in hardware until 5 or 6 generations of hardware later. This was my first GUI based system with - at some point as a young boy I decided that I knew almost everything about computers and if I pulled the machines apart I'd be able to breeze through the reassembly process. What could possibly go wrong ? Right?  
Well - This created a few problems. I ended up ruining a perfectly good IBM XT clone machine, with some parts in it that even back then were not exactly common. This is a future project I have in mind where I grab some kind of Clone IBM XT/286/386 (Which I would cap at a 386 DX-40 and possibly overclock this to 50Mhz) Class machine - and prove that it's still useful for rudimentary functions 
for example - Word processing, spreadsheets, writing documentation and connecting it to a network (being my win10/linux PC) - and just generally having some fun with it by playing some retro computer games using a VGA CRT Monitor. It is this old clunky big heavy system that sparked my interest in technology - not just desktop computing.   
LAter on this would develop   </p>
