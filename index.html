<title> Welcome to Brad's Professional IT Profile S386661 </title>
<h1><center>IT Profile - Personal information </h1></center> 

<h3><center>Who are you reading about?  </h3></center> 
<p> My name is Bradley McCarthy, Student id S386661, Email address S386661@student.rmit.edu.au - Feel free to drop me a line!
The universe decided I'd be created as a wonderful human being with a very mixed background in terms of nationality as my descendants are from all over the world (My Grandmother is from Cairo, Egypt & Grandfather from the border of Yugoslavia / Italy)
Language wise despite the rather mixed backgrounds, I only speak English but I would love to learn another language as I do have interest in travelling. There is a whole world out there and we shouldn't feel "locked" down to any given place. HAving said that, there is nothing wrong with a date night indoors on a Friday night enjoying some pizza and ice cream watching some Sci-fi on TV creating that much needed inner world to explore whilst enjoying with loved ones

<H4> Education  ;</H4>
<p>Education wise - I was quite the avid student in primary school excelling at everything including mathematics with a very keen interest in the universe, history and I can attribute quite a bit of my knowledge to my great uncle who was my "internet" back then with a massive wall of paper encyclopedias
   After moving through primary/secondary school I studied a certificate III in Web applications & Information technology. The course was fairly cruisy and I breezed through this learning new things - such as Flash, dreamweaver, Office applications (more in depth...ie not just how to turn a PC on and type documents) 
   however most of that knowledge isnt' as relevant due to being so out of date. They had Word 95/97 back then and we used notepad to edit HTML mainly for our assignments(required). 
</p> 

<H4> A few interesting facts about me ;</H4>
FACT 1 = I am known to adopt some fairly quirky ideas when solving problems. For example - at my everyday job I spent about two weeks not doing what I was supposed to be. I took advantage of a holiday season - in order to self develop my powershell skills to the next level. 
This resulted in me creating code for a Menu driven system in which I would simply just press a keystroke on my amazing satisfyingly loud mechanical keyboard with blue switches and it would automate an entire process that would take up to 10-15 minutes each time to execute manually!
I had this in the bag after 2-3 weeks of writing it all up. There is just something about the simplicity and control in a terminal I find soothing knowing that it's going to behave exactly like it should. Unlike the GUI that can be unpredictable and cumbersome at times. Yes, it's great having 
a graphical interface - and it's definitely an advancement in the way graphical interaction works - but sometimes it can just take so long to do things that only take mere seconds in the terminal / powershell / bash. 

It looked terrible, the code was horrendously messy - BUT IT WORKED! Most of the time, these ideas seem very out of place and bat-sh*t crazy however when it all clicks into place it's like a satisfactory puzzle that's just been put together.   
I love driving my Ford Focus XR5 Turbo, it's not a car that's designed to throw you out the back window when you give it some beans - however it's a very well balanced fun car to drive when the solid stuff gets bendy. Given that it's 6 speed manual, that makes it even better.   
This is another fun fact about me - I learned how to drive manual after getting the car. I've only stalled it twice since November last year, and they weren't traditional "stalling" mistakes - they were far worse (wrong gear selection) as the car doesn't have a rev limiter to protect the engine 
Aside from this, I'm passionate about making music and have been doing this since Windows 95/98 using Scream Tracker / Impulse tracker and then other newer applications (FL studio 7/8/9/10 and now whatever the almost current version is) 
Sports wise I love Cycling, Tennis and absolutely cannot wait to get back into the gym - part of my routine is getting up at an hour nobody including myself wants to be doing (typically 430am) and getting  30-45 minute workout done if not an hour some days and then getting to work. 
I currently work for a historically known tier 1 computer company through one of it's contractors for a generation site the state relies on for an essential service. Without this service, many of us wouldn't be reading this page right now if plugged into mains

<h2><center>IT Profile - Personal information </center> </h2>
My interest in compters & IT started when my Great uncle and Grandmother purchased an IBM XT with CGA Graphics, 640KB Ram and a 40MB MFM Hard disk with a strange looking keyboard by today's standards. The function keys were on the left, not at the top. There were only ten of them.Very little software made use of 12 function keys 
I had MS-DOS 5.00 loaded on the PC for me and I didn't recieve an "upgrade" in hardware until 5 or 6 generations of hardware later. This was my first GUI based system with - at some point as a young boy I decided that I knew almost everything about computers and if I pulled the machines apart I'd be able to breeze through the reassembly process. What could possibly go wrong ? Right?  
Well - This created a few problems. I ended up ruining a perfectly good IBM XT clone machine, with some parts in it that even back then were not exactly common. This is a future project I have in mind where I grab some kind of Clone IBM XT/286/386 (Which I would cap at a 386 DX-40 and possibly overclock this to 50Mhz) Class machine - and prove that it's still useful for rudimentary functions 
for example - Word processing, spreadsheets, writing documentation and connecting it to a network (being my win10/linux PC) - and just generally having some fun with it by playing some retro computer games using a VGA CRT Monitor. It is this old clunky big heavy system that sparked my interest in technology - not just desktop computing.   
LAter on this would develop   </p>
