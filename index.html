<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #00ff00;">C:\BMAC&gt;Welcome to Brad's Professional IT Profile</span></p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Lv1cmor" alt="&quot;Picture" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Personal information</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ff00;">C:\BMAC&gt;DIR</span></p>
<p>Hi - my name is Bradley McCarthy. My student id is S386661. My student Email address is S386661@student.rmit.edu.au -</p>
<p>Here is a charming "dreamy" Selfie from 2-3 years ago https://imgur.com/Lv1cmor, where I seem to be dangerously gazing into the sun!</p>
<p>Feel free to drop me a line! I have a very mixed background in terms of nationality. My descendants are from all over the world (My Grandmother is from Cairo, Egypt &amp; Grandfather from the border of Yugoslavia / Italy) - I generally have a zest for life and consider myself to be reasonably lucky.</p>
<p>Language-wise despite the somewhat mixed backgrounds. I only speak English, but I would love to learn another language as I do have an interest in traveling where this would come in handy, so I'm not as "Touristy" -. A big challenge for me was growing up; my father never wanted me to learn my family's native tongue (Italian) - My Grandma can speak around seven languages very fluently and is the oldest living member of my family. She is well over 80 and "still has it together."</p>
<p>There is a whole world out there, and we shouldn't feel "locked" down to any given place. Quite often, people feel too busy or lack the motivation to go out and explore the world. There is nothing wrong with a date night indoors on a Friday night enjoying some pizza and ice cream watching some Sci-fi on TV creating that much needed inner world to explore while enjoying time with loved ones.</p>
<p>Education-wise - I was quite an avid student in primary school, excelling at everything, including mathematics. With a very keen interest in the universe, history, and technology still used an Abacus in my primary school before we had computers available. I can attribute my knowledge to my great uncle, who was my "internet" back then with a massive wall of paper encyclopedias. After moving through primary/secondary school, I studied a Certificate III in Web applications &amp; Information technology.</p>
<p>I breezed through this learning new things - such as Flash, Dreamweaver, Office applications (more in-depth i.e., not just how to turn a PC on and type documents)</p>
<p>They had Word 95/97 back then, and we used notepad to edit HTML mainly for our assignments(required). I achieved high distinctions making a few silly mistakes lowering some scores, and I enjoyed this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A few interesting facts about me</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">I am known to adopt some fairly quirky ideas when solving problems. At work, sometimes we get crates of IT Equipment that needed to get delivered around the site. My Plan to save a chunk of time was to get a crane stuck into the containers and lift them from the basement to the turbine floor. Everyone thought I was insane for coming up with this idea, but they all agreed that if you wanted it done quickly, this would be the way to do it. Another fun fact about me - I learned how to drive manual after getting my XR5 turbo I had only stalled it twice since November last year. It's a pretty quick, fun car that gets you to work and back and more on the weekends.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">My interest in IT Sparked by my great uncle got me an IBM XT. It was a bulky, clunky clone PC - The function keys were on the left, not at the top on the keyboard. There were only ten of them. Very little software made use of 12 function keys I had MS-DOS 5.00 loaded on the PC for me, and I didn't receive an "upgrade" in hardware until 5 or 6 generations of equipment later. I ended up ruining a perfectly good IBM XT clone machine, with some parts in it that even back then were not exactly common trying to tinker around. This old clunky big massive system sparked my interest in technology - not just desktop computing. Later on, this would develop Hobbies / Sports I like to get into a bit of Cycling (Mostly Road), Tennis, Gym (Can't wait for it to re-open!). There is just nothing like the simplicity of getting on your bike and going for a ride out in the open elements even better when there is it of sunshine, light winds, and amazing scenery to top it off. In terms of hobbies, I like anime, con events (Cosplay) photography, Cars (Turbo is so much fun!), Creating music, spending time with friends and who doesn't love a tasty bite to eat?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Job description in my own words</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;">This job is appealing directly due to the diversity of applications involved. They want a secure experience of AD, indicating there is support for a domain, engaging users and objects. That's great, and I like interaction with all of those things. Then - it wants a security clearance, which makes it sound bad-ass. Red Hat Enterprise Linux experience is required, Hypervisor, VMWARE - Hyper-V) along AD/Domain, DHCP/DNS/Powershell. There is quite a bit of support/networking involved across the board. It seems like no two days would be the same. I would love to "invent" creative ways to get things done mainly with my newly found programming knowledge and existing PowerShell knowledge to adapt my existing / newly programmed codebase from what I've learned in the course applying it to this! So primarily to be reasonably adept at a course like this I'd need to complete the direction I'm doing now in IT / Programming. Then I'd prefer to have my Cisco CCNA well and truly covered as well as Juniper/Nutanix (NCP &amp; JNCP). A Microsoft Azure Administrator / Solutions expert certificate would hugely benefit from what I'm trying to achieve as well as some IT Security certifications.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EXAMPLE OF JOB</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The job description requires a fairly advanced IT Security skillset and cloud knowledge on top of existing strong IT Administration skills.</p>

<p>IMAGE TO JOB https://imgur.com/Wnjbekv</p>
<p>Why does the job appeal to me</p>
<p>This appeals to me simply because I already have some of the basics covered but not the IT Security and Cloud knowledge. I like the hands-on getting my hands on Linux in a corporate environment, as I've never done that broadening my skills across to that side of the world. I think some Linux scripting/programming knowledge would significantly advance my standardization/scripting capability to achieve some fairly amazing results within a domain. I'll handle a lot of the non-Wintel server stuff - EG EMC Disk servers / Avamar / specialized gear that runs on a terminal without referencing Google as much. They need someone to have networking experienced (It's an SNR network job), so I would also be looking to get some extra certifications IT Senior systems engineer &gt; What Skills do I have now? What qualifications are needed for this? What am I going to do to achieve this?</p>
<p>Experience &amp; Qualifications required for the job</p>
<p>The job mentions that the following is required</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong experience of AD</li>
<li>Strong experience of RHEL</li>
<li>Secure experience of Hypervisor - VMWare or Hyper-V</li>
<li>Extensive experience in MS Infrastructure: Windows Server (2012/2016), Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, PowerShell</li>
</ul>
<p>This would indicate to me that you need https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcts-certification.aspx Microsoft MCTS, which covers the active directory side in detail for servers, which would provide an understanding on the desktop side of it as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"A Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist certification proves your skills on a particular Microsoft technology, such as the Windows operating system, Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SQL Server, or Microsoft Visual Studio. MCTS certifications are no longer in development. However, your MCTS certification will remain valuable as long as companies are using the technology that it certifies. Please check the retired exams and retired certifications pages for specific retirement dates."</p>

<p><strong>VMWARE CERTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p>Anon, 2020. VMware Certification sets the standard for IT professionals. We validate the critical skills required to integrate and manage the technology that drives the desired business outcomes. This covers correct virtualization techniques and optimizing your environment with the use of VMware based hosts/servers. This will be useful for both Linux and Windows VM's - and also pertains to cloud environments. Many companies are migrating bare metal to cloud platforms now, so this knowledge would be beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>A Description of my current job Skills</strong></p>
<p>Currently, I don't have any relevant qualifications that would get me a job like this</p>
<p>My certification covered how to use office applications and program some HTML. There was a bit of Flash programming involved / flash creation combined with some Dreamweaver and other adobe products. In terms of today's requirements the only transferable knowledge would be my current experience in</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Powershell automation (self-taught 2+ years)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Active Directory (Basic user level) - managing software and security groups</strong></li>
<li><strong>Basic Linux / CLI "to get by" when nobody else is around to do it</strong></li>
<li><strong>RDP/MSRA/CLI/WinRM (PS remoting)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Basic SCCM knowledge</strong></li>
<li><strong>Application / remote technical support knowledge</strong></li>
<li><strong>Basic all everyday round run of the mill "IT Guy" for "Tradie" type users to help them get on with the job</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How will I obtain the skills I need?</p>
<p>Well, the first thing I need to focus on doing is complete the IT course I've enrolled in at the moment and be successful in completing the programing side of it as well. Once I achieve this, I will then be able to look forward to completing other certifications I've wanted to do for quite some time. Cisco CCNA, Linux Certification, Microsoft Desktop management skills, Azure / cloud-based certifications. These would require a good chunk of time outside of my course unless RMIT could help incorporate these somehow, so I can "get onto a winner" So essentially it involves buying my way through certifications and passing all of the tests to achieve my goal. Some are "Easier" than others (all are painful to a certain degree) - Eg Cisco CCNA - I've seen what this entails and to be honest the thought of it makes my head explode almost at the sight of GNS3 alone (the virtual software used to emulate the stuff)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>MYERS BRIGGS TEST</strong></p>
<p>https://imgur.com/fcQMBT5</p>
<p>Anon, 2020. <em>AnonymousCampaigner - Assertive Campaigner (ENFP-A) | 16Personalities</em>. [online] 16personalities.com. Available at: &lt;https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/d4b418c30bcd8&gt; [Accessed 18 Jun. 2020].</p>
<p>This test indicates I am an assertive campaigner, a diplomat, and my strategy for handling situations involves "people mastery."</p>
<p>Highlighting what these mean</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PEOPLE MASTERY (short clip)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Finding Balance</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, most People Masters fall somewhere in the middle. Ideally, they embrace healthy ambition while finding social fulfillment and connection. Social interaction plays a big part in People Masters' happiness. Although these personality types are self-confident, they still appreciate praise and recognition. They don't need people's approval, but they still crave friends and loved ones with whom to share their lives.</p>
<p>These types may be stubborn, but they don't always worry about having others agree with them. This can help these personalities to be moderate even in disagreements because their ego and confidence aren't at stake the way they often are for Turbulent Strategies. People Masters are not fond of grudges, and at heart, they want to bring people together to make things happen.</p>
<p>These types often stand out for their charisma and self-assurance. As long as they don't use their talents to steamroll or put down others, these personality traits can be quite appealing. These types have little fear of rejection, and they love, including others. This can make these personalities wonderful friends, loved ones, and colleagues, who always aim to energize them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What does the MBTI indicate for me?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The results of the MBTI test show me that I'm quite extraverted which is quite true - I'm the guy they send in to get the job done while having fun with everyone - not the person that sits in an office soaked in meetings all day and "planning" things but never amounting to work. Energy - Shows I'm very energetic mentally. This is also true, most of the time. I'm not a robot - and hate being stuck to my desk. My nature shows that I'm good at handling emotions and have a good "Feel" for things. Tactics wise - I am known to be a bit of a strategist/master tactician in some cases. Identity wise - the assertive part isn't an exact match as I am probably not assertive enough in a lot of situations&mdash;only some of the time. I wouldn't' say that this is very accurate.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">I think these results suggest that I'm an extroverted team player that gets a good feel for a group while being able to use a bit of tactical strategy for the greater good. For example, if one person seems to be negatively geared towards an idea - I would encourage this as an outlet to facilitate further thinking and ideas rather than grab the "going south express" and enable the negative aspects further in a derogatory way. Assertiveness need not apply here, as I'd avoid this. It's important to note that the MTBI test was created with self-development in mind and seems subjective. If you give ten people a licorice piece, you'll get 20 answers on what it's like with similar meaning. This test would take into account how I'm not a reserved, quiet personality within the team, more a semi-rambunctious character with a little filter applied when it comes to sharing thoughts. Quite often people need to be more concerned about me answering their questions more freely than most would - hence, the need for them to filter the question - rather than have me filter my answer- which I simply don't do - unless I'm on the far end of uncomfortable with the group. At least the group would know all of my thoughts. Communication is a good strength I have, perhaps a bit overdone for those not practiced/versed in this behavior.</span></p>

<p>It is interesting how the test shows that I am LESS of an extrovert, and the results are quite different. However, Imagination is a key strength of mine with my wacky ideas. While in real life, not everyone is going to agree with my imaginative ideas; they would certainly discuss them with me in-depth where required. I don't tend to shy away from talking about ideas if I believe the effort will amount to something considered worthy of the time invested.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Predictive index test</strong></p>
<p>Anon, 2020. [online] Available at: &lt;https://www.predictiveindex.com/assessments/behavioral-assessment/&gt; [Accessed 18 Jun. 2020].</p>
<p>https://i.imgur.com/iKDF29p.png</p>
<p>This test is quite "bang-on" as I get my sense of satisfaction from supporting others - and this holds at work and in most things I do. However, I'm not the most detail-oriented but sometimes get caught up in the details a little too much distracting me from work. My Follow-up "game" is very strong. So it's quite interesting to see all three tests come together with varying results. I've essentially put my hand into the cookie jar and pulled out three different delicious cookies with various characteristics. This does demonstrate how I would help others out in my team but may annoy some people as I'd be focusing more on helping others individually than the entire team when overall progression is desired. If you've got a few people that are a little stuck behind as a collective everyone needs to be on board and we've all got circumstances, so it doesn't hurt to consider that for everybody.</p>
<p>I think this should be taken into account, moving into a team short of teamwork where key players focus more on self progression rather than team progression. There is no "I" in a team.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #00ccff;"><strong>Project idea</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>My project would be about an "EnCon" dynamic module that connects to a smartphone app wirelessly / cell network to automate everyday power conservation. Each module would cost around $59-99 depending on how broad it's function was. Envisage this "module/unit" to connect to your car, to your household appliances/lights/switchboard and powering things off that haven't been used for a set duration of time to save electricity. Instead of having several different apps for different energy providers, apps that save fuel, and even communications apps - It would be a central "energy" hub incorporating everything. It would also serve to track consumption on the app so you can see your overall "Expenditure" and provide tips on how to improve it.</p>
<p>For a smart meter, it would add some "Extra smart" to it by plugging into the circuit board with newly designed circuits that are far more robust and communicate to the app wirelessly on your network with a small master chip. This would give people a better indication of peak vs. off-peak times, and you'd be able to focus on saving energy - and this could also be used for governing bodies as a tracking mechanism for disputes.</p>
<p>I would call this ecosystem "EnCon," It would be able to connect to just about everything desired.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>My motivation for this is based on a personal ethos - why use resources when we don't need to? By being more conscious and having the right modern tools that can do this - it is possible.</p>
<p>The broader application of such a product would be useful in areas where resources are starved and very limited. It would have installations on Marine, military, and domestic use. Marine for better power monitoring and management (Eg cruise ship) - Military/police, to record a solid subset of data for investigative usage. This creates a massive demand for an extremely wide user base. This is the next generation of eco-conscious people as well as the elderly. Hospital applications</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Description</strong></span></p>
<p>The primary basis of the service would be a web/app-based subscription model where the user needs to spend $5 a month for the most basic level of service - the monitoring central hub side of "EnCon" which would focus on far cheaper modules that sell for $29 that do not have any automation capabilities. This is so all energy consumptions/vehicle/communications/appliances/hubs can be monitored in a central location. In this case, "Basic EnCom smart modules" would be installed to a person's smart-meter / fuse box, connect up various appliances for more detailed costs, not just an overall "Feel" of things - and then even somehow connect to the water meter at the property to measure this. All utilities would be connected.</p>
<p>The more capable modules would cost $99 for a basic start-up kit, including a few monitoring modules and an "automation" module. The premium product would be $299 and include 6x monitoring modules, and cover a small house with automation (6x lights, 8x power socket modules, smart-meter module, water module). People who spend $10 p/m on the app would have full access to the cool automation side. This would be the no holds barred version. Car "ECU" module would be available for $49 - there would be several other niche models available. A "Strava" EnCom module would be available for cyclists who commute to work for $35 that works from an ANT+ sensor and collects data from your Garmin / Wahoo unit to track how much fuel/consumption has been saved. When driving, it would calculate your cost of fuel rather than relying on per 100K Ratings that never really show the cost until you fill-up.</p>
<p>A user would simply connect these modules as it if was a network switch or device plugged into their home network and connect every unit up to a Master module included in the box. The master module would need a very high level of security as who wants their house "Hacked"?</p>
<p>Some kind of "locator" module could be used to refine the more conservative modes to follow the person. This could be wearable or the smartphone app. So if you have the wearable on you, or your phone - it won't turn anything off in that room as you're in it (if it's a light or something else you could be using)</p>
<p>But if it's detected, you are leaving the house, and it will gauge this and shut things down as required.</p>
<p>It would be a 2 step setup process.</p>
<p>Step 1 - power on and enter a password when the LED is turned on.</p>
<p>Step 2 - it detects all the modules installed and powered on and connects them - It then loads the default "Eco" profile set to turn anything off automatically after 15 minutes. Naturally, you wouldn't want your fridge connected to this. This is where the monitoring modules would be useful. You'd plug this module into things that didn't need automation but just monitoring.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tools and software / Skills required.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">Engineers to come up with a beta/draft design that can go out to the field, followed by an application that would be able to run the "smart" side of the modules to inform the user of all the consumption involved and tips on how to save, etc. Then, You'd need a factory that can print PCB's to your specification. Software like AutoDesk Eagle would assist in the design of the PCB using CAD software on some moderately specced PCs. Kicad could also be used and is free. AutoDesk requires a subscription nowadays when it never used to. Programmers would be needed to write the smartphone app and firmware/kernel/software for the smart module onto the onboard memory chips that contain the function of each "EnCon" Module. Still, it would also need some very talented "Hackers" or ITSec people (possibly both) to ensure it's as secure as possible around the clock, so people don't have to worry about being compromised. They would need to "harden" the firmware/software as much as possible and only release necessary updates. There would be cloud servers involved to store customer information and manage subscriptions. It would certainly not encourage "ads" or "selling information" - it would be 100% ethical. The data on the servers would not be accessible even to staff without law intervening, noting that even this would be encrypted data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>So in essence ;</strong></p>
<p>Create a program that can measure power usage and automate choices for appliances that can be turned off automatically to save power and make more conscious choices. If successful, it would be a "green" use product. This aims towards a better future for everyone. It would have an impact on the environment if even the product itself could be recycled and attribute towards people using less electricity by using the automation tools provided.</p>
