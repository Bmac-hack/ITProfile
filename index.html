<h2>Welcome To The Best Online HTML Web Editor!</h2>
<p><strong>Welcome to Brad's Professional IT Profile</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Personal information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who are you reading about?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi - my name is Bradley McCarthy. My student id is S386661. My student Email address is S386661@student.rmit.edu.au - </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a charming &ldquo;dreamy&rdquo; Selfie from 2-3 years ago </span><a href="https://imgur.com/Lv1cmor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://imgur.com/Lv1cmor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where I seem to be dangerously gazing into the sun! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feel free to drop me a line! I like to think I&rsquo;m a lovely human being with a very mixed background in terms of nationality as my descendants are from all over the world (My Grandmother is from Cairo, Egypt &amp; Grandfather from the border of Yugoslavia / Italy) - I generally have a zest for life and consider myself to be fairly lucky.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language wise despite the rather mixed backgrounds, I only speak English but I would love to learn another language as I do have interest in travelling where this would come in handy so I&rsquo;m not as &ldquo;Touristy&rdquo; -. A big challenge for me was growing up my father never wanted me learning my families native tongue (Italian) - My Grandma can speak around 7 languages very fluently and is the oldest living member of my family currently. She is well over 80 and &ldquo;still has it together&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a&nbsp; whole world out there and we shouldn't feel "locked" down to any given place. Quite often people feel too busy, or lack the motivation to go out and explore the world. Having said that, there is nothing wrong with a date night indoors on a Friday night enjoying some pizza and ice cream watching some Sci-fi on TV creating that much needed inner world to explore whilst enjoying time with loved ones.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education wise - I was quite the avid student in primary school excelling at everything including mathematics with a very keen interest in the universe, history, technologyWe still used an Abacus in my primary school before we had computers available.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can attribute quite a bit of my knowledge to my great uncle who was my "internet" back then with a massive wall of paper encyclopedias After moving through primary/secondary school I studied a certificate III in Web applications &amp; Information technology.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The course was fairly cruisy and I breezed through this learning new things - such as Flash, dreamweaver, Office applications (more in depth...ie not just how to turn a PC on and type documents) however most of that knowledge isnt' as relevant due to being so out of date.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had Word 95/97 back then and we used notepad to edit HTML mainly for our assignments(required). I achieved high distinctions making a few silly mistakes lowering some scores and I enjoyed this.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A few interesting facts about me&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am known to adopt some fairly quirky ideas when solving problems. At work sometimes we get crates of IT Equipment that need to be delivered around the site. My idea to save a chunk of time was to get a crane stuck into the crates and lift them from the basement up to the turbine floor. Everyone thought I was absolutely insane for coming up with this idea, but at least they all agreed if you wanted it done quickly this would be the way to do it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another fun fact about me - I learned how to drive manual after getting my XR5&nbsp; turbo I've only stalled it twice since November last year. It&rsquo;s a pretty quick, fun car that gets you to work and back and more on the weekends.&nbsp; Sports wise I love Cycling, Tennis and absolutely cannot wait to get back into the gym - part of my routine is getting up at an hour nobody including myself wants to be doing (typically 430am) and getting 30-45 minute workout done if not an hour some days and then getting to work. At work, during the shutdowns / outages - things get very busy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;"><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>My interest in IT Sparked from my great uncle getting me an IBM XT&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a heavy, clunky clone PC - The function keys were on the left, not at the top on the keyboard. There were only ten of them.Very little software made use of 12 function keys I had MS-DOS 5.00 loaded on the PC for me and I didn't recieve an "upgrade" in hardware until 5 or 6 generations of hardware later. This was my first GUI based system with - at some point as a young boy I decided that I knew almost everything about computers and if I pulled the machines apart I'd be able to breeze through the reassembly process. What could possibly go wrong ? Right? Well - This created a few problems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ended up ruining a perfectly good IBM XT clone machine, with some parts in it that even back then were not exactly common. This is a future project I have in mind where I grab some kind of Clone IBM XT/286/386 (Which I would cap at a 386 DX-40 and possibly overclock this to 50Mhz) Class machine - and prove that it's still useful for rudimentary functions for example - Word processing, spreadsheets, writing documentation and connecting it to a network (being my win10/linux PC) - and just generally having some fun with it by playing some retro computer games using a VGA CRT Monitor. It is this old clunky big heavy system that sparked my interest in technology - not just desktop computing. Later on this would develop Hobbies / Sports I like to get into a bit of Cycling (Mostly Road) , Tennis, Gym (Can't wait for it to re-open!) - There is just nothing like the simplicity of getting on your bike and going for a ride out in the open elements. Even better when there is a it of sunshine, light winds and amazing scenry to top it off. In terms of hobbies I like anime, con events (Cosplay) photography, Cars (Turbo is so much fun!) , Creating music, spending time with friends and who doesn't love a good bite to eat?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Job description in my own words&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This job is appealing simply due to the diversity of applications involved. They wany a strong experience of AD indicating there is support for a domain, involving users and objects. That's great, I like interaction with all of those things. Then - it wants a security clearance which makes it sound totally bad-ass. Red Hat enterprise linux experience is needed, along with Virtualization (Hypervisor, VMWARE - Hyper-V) along with basically a number of objects contained within the microsoft lab kit (AD/Domain, DHCP/DNS/ Group policy and one of my favorite IT subjects - Powershell) so it sounds like quite an all-round position. There is quite a bit of support/networking involved across the board. It sounds like no two days would be exactly the same. This appeals to me because I would love to "invent" creative ways to get things done particularly with the use of my newly found programming knowledge and existing powershell knowledge adapting my existing / newly programmed codebase from what I've learned in the course applying it to this! So essentially in order to be fairly adept at a course like this I'd need to complete the course I'm doing now in IT / Programming and then I'd prefer to have my Cisco CCNA well and truly covered as well as Juniper/Nutanix (NCP &amp; JNCP) - A microsofto Azure Administrator / Solutions expert certificate would be hufely benefit from what I'm trying to achieve as well as some IT Security certifications. EXAMPLE OF JOB Lets take a look at a job example as I believe this would cover most of my ideal job minus the extra IT Administration they don't seem to be listing here (which an agency wouldn't list anyway as it's too specific to an environment) The job descsription requires a fairly advanced IT Security skillset and cloud knowledge on top of existing strong IT Administration skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHy does the job appeal to me&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This appeals to me simply due to the fact I already have some of the basics covered but not the IT Security and Cloud knowledge. I like the hands on getting my hands on Linux in a corporate environment as I've never done that broadening my skills across to that side of the world. I think some Linux scripting / programming knowledge would greatly advanced my capability of standardization / scripting in order to achieve some fairly amazing results within a domain. This means I'll be able to handle a lot of the non Wintel server stuff - EG EMC Disk servers / Avamar / specialized gear that runs on a terminal without referencing google as much. They need someone to have networking experienced (It's a SNR network job) so I would be also looking to get some extra certirications IT Senior systems engineer &gt; What Skills do I have now? What qualifications are needed for this? What am I going to do to achieve this? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>Experience &amp; Qualifications required for the job&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The job mentions that the following is required&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong experience of AD</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Strong experience of RHEL</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Strong experience of Hypervisor - VMWare or Hyper-V</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Extensive experience in MS Infrastructure: Windows Server (2012/2016), Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, PowerShell<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">This would indicate to me that you need </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcts-certification.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcts-certification.aspx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Microsoft MCTS&nbsp; which covers the active directory side in detail for servers which would provide an understanding on the desktop side of it as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist certification proves your skills on a particular Microsoft technology, such as the Windows operating system, Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SQL Server, or Microsoft Visual Studio.

<p><strong>A Description of my own current job Skills&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently I don&rsquo;t have any relevant qualifications that would get my a job like this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My certification really only covered how to use office applications and program some HTML. There was a bit of Flash programming involved / flash creation combined with some Dreamweaver and other adobe products but in terms of today&rsquo;s requirements the only transferable knowledge would be my current experience in&nbsp;</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Powershell automation (self taught 2+ years)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active Directory (Basic user level) - managing software and security groups</span></li>

<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How will I obtain the skills I need ? </strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well the firstt thing I need to focus on doing is complete the IT course I&rsquo;ve enrolled in at the moment and be successful in completing the programing side of it as well. Once I achieve this I will then be able to look forward to completing other certifications I&rsquo;ve wanted to do for quite some time. Cisco CCNA, Linux Certification, Microsoft Desktop management skills, Azure / cloud based certifications. These would require a good chunk of time outside of my course unless RMIT coulud help incorporate these somehow so I can &ldquo;get onto a winner&rdquo;&nbsp; So essentially it involves buying my way through certifications and passing all of the tests to achieve my goal. Some are &ldquo;Easier&rdquo; than others (all are painful to a certain degree) - Eg Cisco CCNA - I&rsquo;ve seen what this entails and to be honest the thought of it makes my head explode almost at the sight of GNS3 alone (the virtual software used to emulate the stuff) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>MYERS BRIGGS TEST </strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><a href="https://imgur.com/fcQMBT5"><strong>https://imgur.com/fcQMBT5</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong></a><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/d4b418c30bcd8"><strong>https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/d4b418c30bcd8</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This test indicates I am an assertive campaigner , a diplomat and my strategy for handling situations involves &ldquo;people mastery&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highliting what these mean&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PEOPLE MASTERY (short clip)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding Balance</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, most People Masters fall somewhere in the middle. Ideally, they embrace healthy ambition while finding social fulfillment and connection. Social interaction plays a big part in People Masters&rsquo; happiness. Although these personality types are self-confident, they still appreciate praise and recognition. They don&rsquo;t need people&rsquo;s approval, but they still crave friends and loved ones with whom to share their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These types may be opinionated, but they don&rsquo;t always worry about having others agree with them. This can help these personalities to be moderate even in disagreements because their ego and confidence aren&rsquo;t at stake the way they often are for Turbulent Strategies. People Masters are not fond of grudges, and at heart, they want to bring people together to make things happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These types often stand out for their charisma and self-assurance. As long as they don&rsquo;t use their talents to steamroll or put down others, these personality traits can be quite appealing. These types have little fear of rejection, and they love including others. This can make these personalities wonderful friends, loved ones, and colleagues, who always aim to energize those around them.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;"><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does the MBTI indicate for me ?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the MBTI test show me that I&rsquo;m quite extraverted which is quite true - I&rsquo;m the guy they send in to get the job done whilst having fun with everyone - not the person that sits in an office soaked in meetings all day and &ldquo;planning&rdquo; things but never amounting to work. Energy - Shows I&rsquo;m very energetic mentally. This is also true, most of the time. I&rsquo;m not a robot - and hate being stuck to my desk. My nature shows that I&rsquo;m good with handling emotions and have a good &ldquo;Feel&rdquo; for things. Tactics wise - I am known to be a bit of a strategist / master tactician in some cases. Identity wise - the assertive part isn&rsquo;t an exact match as I am probably not assertive enough in a lot of situations. Only some of the time. I wouldnt&rsquo; say that this is very accurate. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think these results would suggest that I&rsquo;m an extroverted team player that gets a good feel for a group whilst being able to use a bit of tactical strategy for the greater good. Example : if one person seems to be negatively geared towards an idea - I would encourage this as an outlet to facilitate further thinking and ideas rather than grabbing the &ldquo;going south express&rdquo; and enabling the negative aspects further in a derogatory way. Assertiveness need not apply here, as I&rsquo;d avoid this. It&rsquo;s important to note that the MTBI test was originally created more for self development it seems&hellip;.&nbsp; (Eg &ldquo;I like oranges more than lemons&rdquo;) It seems very subjective. If you give 10 people a piece of licorice you&rsquo;ll get 20 answers on what it&rsquo;s like with a similar meaning.&nbsp; This test would take into account how I&rsquo;m not a reserved quet personality within the team more a semi-rambunctious character with very little filter applied when it comes to sharing thoughts. Quite often people need to be more concerned about me answering their questions more freelythan most would - hence, the need for them to filter the question - rather than have me filter my answer-&nbsp; which I simply don&rsquo;t do - unless I&rsquo;m on the far end of uncomfortable with the group. At least the group would know all of my thoughts. Communication is a good strength I have, perhaps a bit overdone for those not practiced / versed in this behaviour.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interesting how the test shows that I am LESS of an extrovert, and the results are quite differing. However, Imagination and agreableness is accounted for. Whilst in real life, not everyone is going to agree with my imaginative ideas they would certainly discuss them with me in depth where required. I don&rsquo;t tend to shy away from talking about ideas, if I believe the effort will amount to something considerably worthy of the time invested.&nbsp;</span></p>

I&rsquo;m not the most detail oriented however , but sometimes do get caught up in the details a little too much distracting me from work. My Follow-up &ldquo;game&rdquo; is very strong. So it&rsquo;s quite interesting to see all three tests come together with varying results. I&rsquo;ve essentially put my hand into the cookie jar and pulled out three different delicious cookies with various characteristics. Kind of like Kinder Surprise. This does demonstrate how I would help others out in my team, but may annoy some people as I&rsquo;d be focusing more on helping others individually than the entire team when overall progression is desired. But that&rsquo;s the thing, if you&rsquo;ve got a few people that are a little stuck behind as a collective everyone needs to be on board and we&rsquo;ve all got circumstances so it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to consider that for everybody. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think this should be taken into account moving into a team short of teamwork where key players focus more on self progression rather than team progression. There is no &ldquo;I&rdquo; in team.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Project idea&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong><strong>Overview&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My project would be about an &ldquo;EnCon&rdquo; dynamic module that connects to a smartphone app wirelessly / cell network&nbsp; in order to automate everyday power conservation. Each module would cost around $59-99 depending on how broad it&rsquo;s function was. Envisage this &ldquo;module / unit&rdquo; being able to connect to your car, to your household appliances / lights / switchboard and powering things off that haven&rsquo;t been used for a set duration of time in order to save electricity.Instead of having several different apps for different energy providers, apps that save fuel, and even communications apps - It would be a central &ldquo;energy&rdquo; hub incorporating everything. It would also serve to track consumption on the app so you can see what your overall &ldquo;Expenditure&rdquo; is and provide tips on how to improve it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for a smart meter, it would add some &ldquo;Extra smart&rdquo; to it by plugging into the circuit board with newly designed circuits that are far more robust and communicate to the app wirelessly on your network with a small master chip. This would give people a better indication of peak vs off-peak times and you&rsquo;d be able to focus on saving energy - and this could also be used for governing bodies as a tracking mechanism for disputes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would call this ecosystem &ldquo;EnCon&rdquo;&nbsp; and it would be able to connect to just about everything desired. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>Motivation</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">My motivation for this is based on a personal ethos - why use resources when we don&rsquo;t need to? By being more conscious and having the right modern tools that can do this - it is absolutely possible. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The broader application of such a product would be useful in areas where resources are starved and very limited. It would have installations on Marine, military, and domestic use. Marine for better power monitoring and management (Eg cruise ship) - Military/police, to record a solid subset of data for investigative usage. This creates a ginormous demand for an extremely wide user base. This is the next generation of eco-conscious people as well as the elderly. Hospital applications </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<p><strong>Description </strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary basis of the service would be a web/app based subscription model where the user needs to spend $5 a month for the most basic level of service - the monitoring central hub side of &ldquo;EnCon&rdquo; which would focus on far cheaper modules that sell for $29 that do not have any automation capabilities. This is so all energy consumptions / vehicle / communications / appliances / hubs can be monitored in a central location. In this case, &ldquo;Basic EnCom smartmodules&rdquo; would be installed to a persons smartmeter / fuse box, connect up various appliances for more detailed costs not just an overall &ldquo;Feel&rdquo; of things - and then even somehow connect to the water meter at the property to measure this. All utilities would be connected. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more capable modules would cost $99 for a basic start-up kit including a few monitoring modules and an &ldquo;automation&rdquo; module. The premium product would be $299 and include 6x monitoring modules, and cover a small house with automation (6x lights, 8x power socket modules, smartmeter module, water module) and people who spend $10 p/m on the app would have full access to the really cool automation side of it. This would be the no holds barred version. Car &ldquo;ECU&rdquo; module would be available for $49 - there would be several other niche models available. A &ldquo;Strava&rdquo; EnCom module would be available for cyclists who commute to work for $35 that works from an ANT+ sensor and collects data from your garmin / Wahoo unit to track how much fuel / consumption has been saved. When driving it would calculate your cost of fuel rather than relying on per 100K Ratings that never really show the cost until you fill up. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A user would simply connect these modules as it if was a network switch or device plugged into their home network and connect every unit up to a Master module included in the box. The master module would need a very high level of security as who wants their house &ldquo;Hacked&rdquo; ?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some kind of &ldquo;locator&rdquo; module could be used to refine the more conservative modes to follow the person. This could be a wearable or the smartphone app. So if you have the wearable on you, or your phone - it won&rsquo;t turn anything off in that room as you&rsquo;re in it (if it&rsquo;s a light or something else you could be using) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if it&rsquo;s detected you are leaving the house, it will try to gauge this and shut things down as required. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be a 2 step setup process</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 1 - power on and enter password when the LED is turned on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 2 - it detects all the modules installed and powered on and connects them - It then loads the default &ldquo;Eco&rdquo; profile set to turn anything off automatically after 15 minutes.Naturally you wouldnt want your fridge connected to this right&hellip;..this is where the monitoring modules would be useful. You&rsquo;d plug this module into things that didn&rsquo;t need automation but just monitoring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>Tools and software / Skills required </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First I would need a team of engineers to come up with a beta/draft design that can go out to the field followed by an application that would be able to run the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; side of the modules to inform the user of all the consumption involved and tips on how to save etc. then, You&rsquo;d need a factory that can print PCB&rsquo;s to your specification. Software like AutoDesk Eagle would be able to assist in the design of the PCB using CAD software on some moderately specced PC&rsquo;s. Kicad could also be used and is free. AutoDesk requires a subscription nowadays when it never used to.Progrmmers would be needed to write the smart phone app and firmware / kernel / software for the smart module onto the onboard memory chips that contain the function of each &ldquo;EnCon&rdquo; Module but it would also need some very clever &ldquo;Hackers&rdquo; or ITSec people (possibly both) in order to ensure it&rsquo;s as secure as possible around the clock so people don&rsquo;t have to worry about things being compromised. They would need to &ldquo;Harden&rdquo; the firmware / software as much as possibl and only release updates that were absolutely necessary. There would be cloud servers involved to store customer information and manage subscriptions. Would certainly not encourage &ldquo;ads&rdquo; or &ldquo;selling information&rdquo; - it would be 100% Ethical and the data on the servers would not be accessible even to staff without law intervening noting that even this would be encrypted data.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Anon, 2020. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">KiCad EDA</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><strong>So in essence ;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a program that can measure power usage and automate choices for appliances that can be turned off automatically to save power and help a person make more conscious choices. If successful it would be a &ldquo;green&rdquo; use product. This aims towards a better future for everyone. It would have an impact on the environment if even the product itself could be recycled and attribute towards people using less electricity by using the automation tools provided.&nbsp;</span></p>
