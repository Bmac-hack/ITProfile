    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Project idea</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">My project would be about an Encon dynamic module that connects to a smartphone app wirelessly / cell network to automate everyday power conservation. Each module would cost around $59-99 depending on how broad it's function was. Envisage this <em>module/unit</em> to connect to your car, to your household appliances/lights/switchboard and powering things off that haven't been used for a set duration of time to save electricity. Instead of having several different apps for different energy providers, apps that save fuel, and even communications apps - It would be a central energy hub incorporating everything. It would also serve to track consumption on the app so you can see your overall Expenditure and provide tips on how to improve it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">For a smart meter, it would add some <em>Extra smart</em> to it by plugging into the circuit board with newly designed circuits that are far more robust and communicate to the app wirelessly on your network with a small master chip. This would give people a better indication of peak vs. off-peak times, and you'd be able to focus on saving energy - and this could also be used for governing bodies as a tracking mechanism for disputes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">I would call this ecosystem EnCon, It would be able to connect to just about everything desired.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Motivation</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">My motivation for this is based on a personal ethos - why use resources when we don't need to? By being more conscious and having the right modern tools that can do this - it is possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">The broader application of such a product would be useful in areas where resources are starved and very limited. It would have installations on Marine, military, and domestic use. Marine for better power monitoring and management (Eg cruise ship) - Military/police, to record a solid subset of data for investigative usage. This creates a massive demand for an extremely wide user base. This is the next generation of eco-conscious people as well as the elderly. Hospital applications</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Description</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">The primary basis of the service would be a web/app-based subscription model where the user needs to spend $5 a month for the most basic level of service - the monitoring central hub side of Encon which would focus on far cheaper modules that sell for $29 that do not have any automation capabilities. This is so all energy consumptions/vehicle/communications/appliances/hubs can be monitored in a central location. In this case, Basic EnCom smart modules would be installed to a person's smart-meter / fuse box, connect up various appliances for more detailed costs, not just an overall Feel of things - and then even somehow connect to the water meter at the property to measure this. All utilities would be connected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">The more capable modules would cost $99 for a basic start-up kit, including a few monitoring modules and an "automation" module. The premium product would be $299 and include 6x monitoring modules, and cover a small house with automation (6x lights, 8x power socket modules, smart-meter module, water module). People who spend $10 p/m on the app would have full access to the cool automation side. This would be the no holds barred version. Car ECU module would be available for $49 - there would be several other niche models available. A "Strava" EnCom module would be available for cyclists who commute to work for $35 that works from an ANT+ sensor and collects data from your Garmin / Wahoo unit to track how much fuel/consumption has been saved. When driving, it would calculate your cost of fuel rather than relying on per 100K Ratings that never really show the cost until you fill-up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">A user would simply connect these modules as it if was a network switch or device plugged into their home network and connect every unit up to a Master module included in the box. The master module would need a very high level of security as who wants their house Hacked?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Some kind of locator module could be used to refine the more conservative modes to follow the person. This could be wearable or the smartphone app. So if you have the wearable on you, or your phone - it won't turn anything off in that room as you're in it (if it's a light or something else you could be using)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">But if it's detected, you are leaving the house, and it will gauge this and shut things down as required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">It would be a 2 step setup process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Step 1 - power on and enter a password when the LED is turned on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Step 2 - it detects all the modules installed and powered on and connects them - It then loads the default Eco profile set to turn anything off automatically after 15 minutes. Naturally, you wouldn't want your fridge connected to this. This is where the monitoring modules would be useful. You'd plug this module into things that didn't need automation but just monitoring.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Tools and software / Skills required.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineers to come up with a beta/draft design that can go out to the field, followed by an application that would be able to run the smart side of the modules to inform the user of all the consumption involved and tips on how to save, etc. Then, You'd need a factory that can print PCB's to your specification. Software like AutoDesk Eagle would assist in the design of the PCB using CAD software on some moderately specced PCs. Kicad could also be used and is free. AutoDesk requires a subscription nowadays when it never used to. Programmers would be needed to write the smartphone app and firmware/kernel/software for the smart module onto the onboard memory chips that contain the function of each Encon Module. Still, it would also need some very talented Hackers or ITSec people (possibly both) to ensure it's as secure as possible around the clock, so people don't have to worry about being compromised. They would need to harden the firmware/software as much as possible and only release necessary updates. There would be cloud servers involved to store customer information and manage subscriptions. It would certainly not encourage ads or selling information - it would be 100% ethical. The data on the servers would not be accessible even to staff without law intervening, noting that even this would be encrypted data.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>So in essence ;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Create a program that can measure power usage and automate choices for appliances that can be turned off automatically to save power and make more conscious choices. If successful, it would be a "green" use product. This aims towards a better future for everyone. It would have an impact on the environment if even the product itself could be recycled and attribute towards people using less electricity by using the automation tools provided.</span></p>
