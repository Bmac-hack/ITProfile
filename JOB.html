<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Why does the job appeal to me</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">I like the idea of exploring a wide range of new skills to advance my career even further combining this with what I learn from RMIT to apply this in my IT career. Essentially I would learn how to harden networks, learn about the Linux side of it more which isn&rsquo;t something I encounter every day in the workforce and then I would also be able to get into the realm of virtualization, and a good feel for MS Infrastructure (Group policy, domain roles, AD / DNS / DHCP) - more importantly it would give me a deeper mechanical understanding of how Linux/Windows operates than what I can employ now.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>Experience &amp; Qualifications required for the job</strong></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><span style="color: #b2cade;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Microsoft certification</em> that covers how to correctly administer the domain and sub-level features would be ideal. How to manage your staff/users and the software in the environment.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A certification that covers the desktop and server/cloud side would be largely beneficial as a senior support staff member. Having this certification gives you a good foundation of the tool-set that Microsoft would have</span></span><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you employ in the everyday life of a qualified IT administrator on the&nbsp; side. So rather than being a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">click-next administrator</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this would provide a better understanding of what&rsquo;s under the hood. As an example - you would be a very well certified IT staff member that knew how to get things done rather than a clever researcher. These two cannot be mutually exclusive.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #bed9a9;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>VMware Certification</em> would cover how to utilize correct virtualization techniques so things don&rsquo;t go wrong as easy and there is a full understanding of how Windows/Linux/Other systems get implemented whether it&rsquo;s for raw material boxes or cloud infrastructure. By having this certification you are using VMware to its capability and applying it securely. This would be extremely handy to have on top of the Microsoft certifications where any virtualization will be beneficial as the two can be combined for various applications. Eg deploying a windows server 2019 box on a cloud farm for hosting a service</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #88c6c1;"><em>Cisco CCNA</em> would provide further tools I need to gain a very deep understanding of how everything connects to a network. Without this knowledge or understanding how everything ties together on the network, this facilitates better problem management and well-handled deployments where there is no guesswork involved. This would cover routing tables, DHCP, DNS, Vlan&rsquo;s, infrastructure, Power over ethernet, wiring up fibre/ethernet cables, and even how to secure the network correctly &amp; use the cisco console effectively without needing to refer to the documentation every 5 seconds.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>A Description of my current job Skills</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">Currently, I don't have any relevant qualifications that would get me a job like this, however-&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #c2c7d1;">My previous certification in IT&nbsp; covered how to use office applications and program some HTML. This is not enough. In terms of today's requirements, the only transferable knowledge would be my current experience in</span></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #5ec658;"><strong>Powershell automation (self-taught 2+ years)</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #aabdd2;"><strong>Active Directory (Basic user level) - managing software and security groups</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #90c1bf;"><strong>Basic Linux / CLI "to get by"&nbsp;</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #708ea4;"><strong>RDP/MSRA/CLI/WinRM (PS remoting)</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #74d4e7;"><strong>Basic SCCM knowledge</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #b6e9b8;"><strong>Application / remote technical support knowledge</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #b7ecef;"><strong>Very Basic MSOL experience.&nbsp;</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #d3e7bb;"><strong>Knowledge of hardware/componentry&nbsp;</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #d1dbb3;"><strong>onsite IT support&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2c7d1;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c2c7d1;"><strong>How will I obtain the skills I need?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ccffcc;">Well, the first thing I need to focus on doing is complete the Bachelor of IT / programming Once I achieve this, I will then be able to look forward to completing other certifications I've wanted to do for quite some time. Cisco CCNA, Linux Certification, Microsoft Desktop management skills, Azure / cloud-based certifications. These would require a good chunk of time outside of my course unless RMIT could help incorporate these somehow into the existing structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
